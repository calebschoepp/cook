## Cookware

- instant pot

## Steps

1. Place all of your ingredients into your instant pot bowl in the following
order: chicken breasts, black beans, white beans, onion, corn, diced tomatoes
with green chilis, and chicken broth.

2. Add chili powder, cumin powder, and ranch dip or dressing mix. Stir
everything to combine, getting some of the juice under the chicken to keep it
from scorching.

3. Cut cream cheese and place over the top of the chili. Cover and seal with
lid, switch the valve to the "sealing" position and cook for 20 minutes on
manual high pressure. Once it is done cooking, let it naturally depressurize for
10 minutes then switch the valve to the "venting" position to completely release
steam before opening the lid.

4. Remove the chicken breasts to a plate and shred apart with 2 forks. Stir
everything together in the pot to melt the cream cheese into the chili then
return the shredded chicken and stir to combine. Serve garnished with avocado
and cilantro if desired.

5. Serve with tortilla chips or baked potatoes to serve.

> **Note:** You can also just do this in the slow cooker.
