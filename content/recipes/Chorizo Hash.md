- *1 tbsp* oil
- *200 g* green bell pepper
- parsley
- *4 tbsp* mayonnaise
- *0.25 tbsp* garlic (pureed)
- *1* onion (sliced)
- *2 tbsp* balsamic vinegar
- *1 tsp* sugar
- *250 g* chorizo sausage
- *1 tbsp* smoked paprika-garlic blend
- *0.25 tbsp* garlic (pureed)
- *250 g* chorizo sausage
- *113 g* baby tomatoes
- *2 tbsp* butter
- *2* eggs

## Cookware

- baking sheet
- non-stick pan
- non-stick pan

## Steps

1. Before starting, preheat the oven to 425°F. Wash and dry all produce. Cut
potato into 1/2-inch pieces. Add potato and oil to a baking sheet lined with
parchment. Season with salt and ground black pepper then toss to coat. Roast in
the middle of the oven, flipping halfway through, until tender and golden-brown,
18-20 minutes.

2. Meanwhile, core, then cut green bell pepper into 1/2-inch pieces. Finely chop
parsley. Stir together mayonnaise, half the parsley and garlic in a small bowl.
Set aside.

3. Heat a large non-stick pan over medium heat. When hot, add oil, then onion.
Cook, stirring often, until slightly softened, 3-4 minutes. Add balsamic vinegar
and sugar. Season with salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until dark golden-
brown, 4-6 minutes. Remove the pan from heat. Transfer onion to another small
bowl and set aside. Carefully wipe the pan clean.

4. Heat the same pan over medium-high. When hot, add oil, then green pepper.
Cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, 3-4 minutes. Add chorizo sausage,
smoked paprika-garlic blend and remaining garlic. Cook, breaking up chorizo
sausage into smaller pieces, until no pink remains, 4-5 minutes. Season with
salt and ground black pepper.

5. Add potato, baby tomatoes, and remaining parsley to the pan with chorizo
sausage. Stir to combine. Divide hash between bowls, then top with caramelized
onion. Dollop parsley aioli over top.

6. Earlier, while chorizo sausage cooks, heat a medium non-stick pan over
medium-low heat. When hot, add butter, then swirl the pan until melted. Crack in
eggs (dbl for 4 ppl). Season with salt and ground black pepper. Cover and pan-
fry until egg whites are set, 2-3 minutes. (NOTE: The yolks will still be runny.
If preferred, pan-fry eggs using oil, instead of butter.) Top hash with a fried
egg before serving.
