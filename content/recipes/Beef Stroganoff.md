# Beef Stroganoff

> Great for a cold winter day

## Ingredients

- *1 lb* beef (tenderloin, ribeye, or sirloin)
- *1 medium* onion (sliced)
- *200 g* mushrooms (sliced)
- garlic
- *1/2 teaspoon* smoked paprika
- *pinch* cayenne pepper
- *100 ml* white wine
- *500 ml* beef broth
- *1/3 cup* sour cream

## Steps

1. Cut beef into thin strips. Season with salt and pepper. Coat with oil.

2. Place beef into a hot skillet (in batches if necessary to enhance browning).
Sear until browned on all sides but still raw in the center, about 2-3 minutes
per side. Remove from skillet and set aside.

3. Add onion, mushrooms, and olive oil to skillet. Sauté until softened, about
5 minutes.

4. Add garlic, smoked paprika, and cayenne pepper to the skillet and cook a
little bit more.

5. Deglaze the pan with white wine or cognac, scraping up any browned bits from
the bottom of the skillet. Add beef broth and bring to a simmer.

6. After simmering for awhile thicken it with a cornstarch slurry as necessary.

7. Stir in sour cream and return the beef and juices to the skillet. Add dijon
mustard.

8. Serve with egg noodles or rice. Garnish with chopped green onions and thyme.
