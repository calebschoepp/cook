## Cookware

- dutch oven

## Steps

1. Preheat the oven to 425° F.

2. Heat large dutch oven over high heat with extra virgin olive oil. Add
boneless chicken breasts or thighs. Season chicken with dried oregano, paprika,
cayenne pepper, fresh thyme leaves, salt, and ground black pepper. Sear on both
sides until golden, 3-5 minutes. Remove chicken from the skillet and set aside.

3. To the skillet, add salted butter, dry rice, shallots, and garlic. Cook until
the rice is toasted. During the last 2 minutes of cooking, add salted butter and
lemon. Allow the butter to brown around the lemons.

4. Pour in low sodium chicken broth. Mix in chopped spinach. Season with salt
and ground black pepper. Bring to a boil. Slide the chicken and any juices
left on the plate back into the skillet. Bring to a boil. Cover the skillet and
turn the heat down to the lowest setting possible. Allow the rice to cook for
10 minutes, until most of the liquid has cooked into the rice, but not all of
it. If needed, add more broth. Bake, uncovered for 10-15 minutes or until the
chicken is cooked through.

5. Meanwhile, mix pitted green olives, crumbled feta cheese, fresh basil leaves,
and lemon juice. Drizzle over extra virgin olive oil and season with salt.

6. Serve the chicken and rice topped with feta, olives, and fresh basil.
Sometimes I like to add avocado.
