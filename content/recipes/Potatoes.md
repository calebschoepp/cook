# Potatoes

> So versatile!

## Steps

1. Roast em, mash em, fry em, bake em, boil em, hasselback em, hashbrown em!
Get exotic.

2. Top em with ketchup, sour cream, chives, cheese, bacon bits, butter, garlic,
herbs, gravy, or whatever you like.

3. Don't forget sweet potatoes too! They're good with brown sugar.
