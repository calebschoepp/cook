# Spicy Honey Lime Chicken

#chicken

> The combination of honey (or maple syrup), soy sauce, sriracha, lime, garlic
> and ginger in this spicy honey lime chicken recipe is wicked. Delicious hot,
> room temp or cold.

## Ingredients

- *3 tbsp* soy sauce
- *6 tbsp* honey
- *1 tsp* lime zest (from one lime)
- *3 tbsp* lime juice (from 1 1/2 to 2 limes)
- *4 cloves* garlic (minced)
- *1.5 tbsp* ginger (grated fresh)
- *1 tbsp* vegetable oil
- *1.5 tbsp* Sriracha sauce (for pretty spicy)
- *1.25 tsp* kosher salt
- *0.5 tsp* cornstarch (to thicken to glaze consistency)
- *2.5 pounds* chicken thighs (boneless skinless)
- *2 tbsp* cilantro (chopped)
- lime wedges

## Cookware

- BBQ

## Steps

1. Whisk together soy sauce, honey, lime zest, lime juice, garlic, ginger,
vegetable oil, Sriracha sauce, kosher salt, and cornstarch.

2. Pour the marinade into a sealed zipper bag or container and add chicken
thighs. Marinate for 30 minutes at room temperature or 6-12 hours in fridge.

> **Note:** Tip: if marinating overnight, leave out lime juice and increase zest so it doesn't 'cook' the chicken. The reserved marinade will be used for glazing/basting.

> **Note:** Optional but suggested: Mix @cornstarch{1/2%tsp} into reserved marinade and microwave for 1 minute to make a glaze-like consistency.

3. Grill chicken on BBQ. Baste the chicken throughout with the leftover
marinade.

4. Rest chicken, loosely covered for 5 minutes.

5. Serve with cilantro and lime wedges if desired.
