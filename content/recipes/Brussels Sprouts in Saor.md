# Brussels Sprouts in Saor

> Roasted brussels sprouts topped with a Venetian-style sweet-and-sour saor of
> onions, saffron, pine nuts, and wine-soaked raisins.

## Ingredients

- *1/2 cup* golden raisins
- *1/2 cup* dry white wine
- *2 1/2 lb* brussels sprouts (trimmed, halved)
- *4 Tbsp* extra-virgin olive oil
- *1/2 tsp* fine sea salt
- *3 Tbsp* extra-virgin olive oil
- *2 medium* yellow onions (thinly sliced)
- *1/4 tsp* saffron (crumbled)
- *1/3 cup* pine nuts
- *2 Tbsp + 2 tsp* white wine vinegar
- *1 Tbsp* granulated sugar
- *to taste* black pepper
- *1 Tbsp* flat-leaf parsley (finely chopped)
- *3 Tbsp* extra-virgin olive oil
- *0.5* lemon

## Steps

1. Preheat oven to 400°F. Place racks in the middle-upper and middle-lower
positions. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment.

2. In a small bowl, combine golden raisins and dry white wine. Set aside to
soak.

3. In a large bowl, toss brussels sprouts with extra-virgin olive oil. Season
with fine sea salt. Spread evenly on the prepared baking sheets.

4. Roast sprouts until tender and deeply golden, about 30 minutes. Halfway
through, rotate pans, switch rack positions, and flip sprouts for even browning.

5. While sprouts roast, heat a large nonreactive skillet over medium-high
heat with extra-virgin olive oil. When shimmering, add yellow onions, a
generous pinch of salt, and saffron. Reduce heat to medium and cook, stirring
occasionally, until onions are tender and lightly browned, about 18 minutes.

6. Spread pine nuts on a small baking sheet and toast in the oven until lightly
golden, 4 minutes.

7. When onions are done, add the soaked raisins and wine, toasted pine nuts,
white wine vinegar, granulated sugar, black pepper, flat-leaf parsley, a
generous pinch of salt, and extra-virgin olive oil. Bring to a gentle simmer,
then remove from heat. Taste and adjust seasoning—the mixture should be sweet
and bright.

8. To serve, mound half the brussels sprouts on a platter and spoon over half
the saor mixture. Finish with a generous squeeze of lemon. Repeat with remaining
sprouts, saor, and lemon.

9. Serve warm or at room temperature. Leftovers keep refrigerated for up to
5 days.
