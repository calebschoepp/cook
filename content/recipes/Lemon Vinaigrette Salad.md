# Lemon Vinaigrette Salad

> This easy lemon vinaigrette recipe is delicious and versatile - perfect for
> tossing with salads, roasted vegetables, and more!

## Ingredients

- *0.25 c* lemon juice
- *1* garlic (grated)
- *1 tsp* Dijon mustard
- *0.25 tsp* sea salt
- ground black pepper
- *0.5 tsp* honey
- *1/4 to 1/3 c* extra-virgin olive oil
- *to taste* extra-virgin olive oil
- *0.5 tsp* thyme

## Steps

1. In a small bowl, whisk together lemon juice , garlic, Dijon mustard, sea
salt, ground black pepper, and honey.

2. Drizzle in extra-virgin olive oil while whisking and continue to whisk until
the dressing is emulsified. Alternatively, combine everything in a jar with a
tight-fitting lid and shake to combine.

3. If your dressing is too tangy, add more extra-virgin olive oil.

4. Add thyme, if desired, and season to taste. Store in the fridge for up to
1 week.

> **Note:** The olive oil will solidify a bit in the fridge. To soften, let the dressing sit at room temp for a few minutes and stir before using.
