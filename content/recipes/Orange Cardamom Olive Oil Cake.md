## Steps

### Cake

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F.

2. Grease a 9-inch springform pan lined with parchment.

3. Whisk the eggs and sugar in a large bowl until light in color. Add the olive
oil, orange juice, orange zest, vanilla and almond extract and stir to blend.

4. Combine the gluten-free all-purpose flour, almond flour, baking powder,
baking soda, cardamom, and salt in a separate bowl.

5. Add to the wet ingredients, stirring to blend without over-mixing. Pour into
the prepared pan. Let rest for 10 minutes to let the flour hydrate.

6. Bake until the cake is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center
comes clean, about 40 minutes.

### Glaze

1. While the cake is baking, prepare the glaze. Combine the sugar and orange
juice in a small saucepan.

2. Simmer until the sugar dissolves and the liquid reduces to a syrupy
consistency, about 2 minutes, stirring constantly.

3. Add the sea salt and simmer 1 minute, stirring frequently.

4. Transfer the cake from the oven to a wire rack. Brush the top with the glaze
and cool 10 minutes.

5. Remove the sides of the pan, then brush the cake on the sides with the glaze.
Cool completely.

### Topping

1. Whip heavy cream until medium peaks form add powdered sugar, vanilla extract
and cardamom.

2. Dust cake with powdered sugar and top with whipped cream.
